        Tantrotsav is the annual technical and non-technical fest of Amrita
        Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Chennai Campus. The name "Tantrotsav" combines the
        Sanskrit words "Tantra," meaning technology, and "Utsav," meaning
        festival, symbolizing a vibrant celebration of technical prowess and
        creativity. The festival celebrates the spirit of innovation,
        engineering, and technology with a diverse range of competitions,
        workshops, lectures, and exhibitions. This fest features an array of
        over 100+ events, including hackathons, coding challenges, robotics
        competitions, tech-talks by eminent personalities, panel discussions,
        and hands-on workshops aimed at fostering technical skills and
        knowledge. Exhibitions showcasing projects and demonstrations of
        emerging technologies are also key highlights of the event. Tantrotsav
        is entirely organized and managed by the students of Amrita Chennai
        Campus, emphasizing teamwork, leadership, and innovation. It attracts
        participants from all over India, making it a hub for collaboration,
