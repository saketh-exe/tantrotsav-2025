        Tantrotrotsav is the annual technical festival of the Amrita Vishwa
        Vidyapeetham, Chennai Campus. The festival celebrates the spirit of
        innovation, engineering, and technology with a diverse range of
        competitions, workshops, lectures, and exhibitions. The name
        "Tantrotrotsav" combines the Sanskrit words "Tantra," meaning
        technology, and "Utsav," meaning festival, symbolizing a vibrant
        celebration of technical prowess and creativity. This fest features an
        array of events such as hackathons, coding challenges, robotics
        competitions, tech-talks by eminent personalities, panel discussions,
        and hands-on workshops aimed at fostering technical skills and
        knowledge. Exhibitions showcasing cutting-edge projects and
        demonstrations of emerging technologies are also key highlights of the
        event. Traditionally held over three action-packed days, Tantrotrotsav
        is entirely organized and managed by the students of Amrita Chennai
        Campus, emphasizing teamwork, leadership, and innovation. It attracts
        participants from all over India, making it a hub for collaboration,
        networking, and the exchange of ideas. Having grown significantly since
        its inception, Tantrotrotsav continues to inspire and empower young
        minds to think beyond boundaries and shape the future of technology.{" "}
